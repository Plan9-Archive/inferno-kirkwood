# status

one clock is set up, a few interrupts come in (it prints a line),
then it crashes.

next steps:
- handle clock interrupts reliably
- get uart working properly, with interrupts


# intro

this is to be a port of inferno to the kirkwood soc, and the
sheevaplug in particular/at first.

this is work in progress.


# instructions

make sure the contents of this directory are available in
$ROOT/os/kirkwood/.

to compile a kernel, "mk install".  this will create "uisheeva" and
"uisheeva.gz" (the same kernels, but one is compressed).  these are
in the "uimage" format, as expected by the sheeva's u-boot.

for compiling a kernel, the program "mkuimage" is needed.  build &
install it it by "cd mkuimage && mk install".


# licence

the kernel code is released under the same licence as the inferno-os
code.

mkuimage is public domain, written by mechiel lukkien, reachable
at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.
